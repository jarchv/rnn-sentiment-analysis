# Recurrent Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis

We train a Recurrent Neural Network with Dropout regularization to classify movie reviews from the 50k IMDb review dataset that has been collected by Maas et. al.

Default parameters:

    * Learning Rate: lr     = 2.5e-3
    * Batch        : BATCH  = 100 (SGD)
    * Epochs       : NEPOCH = 10
